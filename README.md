## Random bite sized examples
This Unity2d project contains various small code samples I cooked up while learning Unity.

For memories sake.


### Examples List:

---
- 01 making a sprite 2d turret follow the mouse
- 02 making a sprite 2d turret follow an object
- 03 procedurally create a hex grid using a prefab hex (mesh or sprite). 2d perspective.
- 04 procedurally create a hexagon mesh
- 05 procedurally create a hex grid from the created hex mesh from 04
- 06 starting with the grid from 03 (modified), highlight multiple hexes based on mouse position
- 07 try out an MVC pattern I found on the nets
- 08 playing with delegates and events. play extended to some dumb stuff, but wanted to see if i could do it. mainly making a toggle effect
- 99 catch all. things tried and failed, or ultimately not used but I might want to reference again
